# Problem

A short explanation of your problem or use-case is helpful!

**Input**

Here's how I'm using normalizr:

```js
// Add as much relevant code and input as possible
// const mySchema = new Schema('myschema');
// normalize({ .../* fill in some input */ }, mySchema);
```

**Output**

Here's what I expect to see when I run the above:

```js
// What you expect to see after running normalizr with your provided input, schema, etc (above)
// {
//     result: [1, 2],
//     entities: { ... }
// }
```
