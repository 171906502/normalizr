If you're looking for help implementing something with normalizr or dealing with data after it's been normalized, you're more likely to get a quick response from somewhere like StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/normalizr

# Problem

A short explanation of your problem or use-case is helpful!

**Input**

Here's how I'm using normalizr:

```js
// Add as much relevant code and input as possible.
const myData = {
  // This section is really helpful! A minimum test case goes a long way!
};
const mySchema = new schema.Entity('myschema');
normalize(myData, mySchema);
```

**Output**

Here's what I expect to see when I run the above:

```js
{
    result: [1, 2],
    entities: { ... }
}
```

Here's what I *actually* see when I run the above:

```js
{
    result: [1, 2],
    entities: { ... }
}
```
